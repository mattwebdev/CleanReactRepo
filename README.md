#Inspiration
finding a clean react-redux repo to work from is hard, and i wanted to give anyone the ability to start playing 
with this stuff quickly.

#Installation 
- Clone the Repo
- `cd` into the root directory
- run `yarn && yarn start` -- or `npm install && npm start`

#Directory Structure
@TODO

#Credits
*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).*
